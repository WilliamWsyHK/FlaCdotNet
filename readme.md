This is my first Open Source Project in my favourite .NET environment.
The project needs to use libFLAC.lib & libFLAC++.lib to compile the libFlaCdotNet.dll.
As FlaC is a **Free Lossless Audio Codec**, this **FlaCdotNet** will also be using the same license too.

Please refer to the project and see the license files.

Finally, I appreciate any improvement for this project, please report bugs if you find anything wrong (even spelling mistake :smiley:); or want something to add;
If you want to contribute codes, *then please follow the syntax guideline (Guideline.md)* for this project!

## Example
Use the .NET convention to code just like using libFLAC++
``` C#
encoder.Init();
encoder.SetMetadata(metadata);
```

## How to Compile
You need to download the source code from [FLAC official site](http://xiph.org/flac/), Ogg library ([xiph.org download site](http://xiph.org/downloads/)) for FLAC compiled with Ogg support.
Finally, put these *.h files in include folder
* FLAC
  * all.h
  * assert.h
  * callback.h
  * export.h
  * format.h
  * metadata.h
  * ordinals.h
  * stream_decoder.h
  * stream_encoder.h
* FLAC++
  * all.h
  * decoder.h
  * encoder.h
  * export.h
  * metadata.h
and these *.lib files in lib folder
* Win32/x64
  * Debug/Release
    * libFLAC_static.lib
    * libFLAC++_static.lib
    * libogg_static.lib
    * win_utf8_io_static.lib

## Important
This project only tested in x86, for both encoding and decoding parts.
(Test cases are from example_cpp_encode_file/example_cpp_decode_file projects)
This project expects you to add Ogg support. (Although created unit test case for ogg, it is not actually tested.)

## **Some Trivia**
There are some problems found in Unit test for decoder, which cannot be passed, but the generated file is ~100% same as the original test from FLAC.
Those are the stream info min/max frame size, and unknown type (used application instead).
See the source code and the generated file for details.

# Also Important Note
Use this kind of code to change values
``` C#
using FlaCdotNet;
using FlaCdotNet.Metadata;
...
var point = new SeekTable.SeekPoint();
point.SampleNumber = ulong.MaxValue;
point.StreamOffset = 1000;
point.FrameSamples = streamInfo.MinBlockSize;
seekTable.InsertPoint(1, point);
...
```
to replace this (since the following example cannot update values as desired)
``` C#
using FlaCdotNet;
using FlaCdotNet.Metadata;
...
//seekTable.NumPoints = 2;
seekTable.TemplateAppendPlaceholders(2);
seekTable[1].SampleNumber = ulong.MaxValue;
seekTable[1].StreamOffset = 1000;
seekTable[1].FrameSamples = streamInfo.MinBlockSize;
...
```
